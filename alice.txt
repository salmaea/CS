"Seven years and six months!" Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully. "An uncomfortable
sort of age. Now if you'd asked my advice, I'd have said 'Leave off at seven' - but
it's too late now."

"I never ask advice about growing," Alice said indignantly.

"Too proud?" the other inquired.

Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. "I mean," she said, "that one
can't help growing older."

"One can't, perhaps," said Humpty Dumpty, "but two can.  With proper assistance,
you might have left off at seven."
